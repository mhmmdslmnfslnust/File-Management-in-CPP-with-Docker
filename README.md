# File-Management-in-C++ (Dockerized)

This is a **C++-based command-line file system simulator**, now with a **Docker container** for easy execution ‚Äî no setup or compilation required! It mimics a basic file system with commands like creating files and directories, reading/writing files, navigating, and saving/loading persistent structure.
